## visualizing air data in houston, texas

### Domain Description
Houston is the hub of chemical manufacturing and energy production in the nation
with many refineries and chemical facilities. To monitor the air quality and potential
emissions across the state, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality's (TCEQ) has
automated gas chromatograph (AutoGC) monitoring sites to monitor several compounds such
as benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene, xylenes, and 1,3-butadiene. Additionally, these sites
record meteorological data such as wind that can impact air quality and distribution of
any emissions.

Since the measurements may be difficult to interpret, a visualization tool is useful to
visualize the measurements in comprehensible format to understand trends of concentrations
over time and areas of high concentration of chemical compounds. 

### Brief overview of the dataset
My core dataset is from the Kinder Urban Data Portal which is a collection of data from TCEQ
monitoring sites. The data format is a .csv file that spans data from 2020 with >50 compounds.
