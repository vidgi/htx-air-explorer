Houston is the hub of chemical manufacturing and energy production in the nation with many refineries and chemical facilities. To monitor the air quality and potential emissions across the state, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality's (TCEQ) has automated gas chromatograph (AutoGC) monitoring sites to monitor several compounds such as benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene, xylenes, and 1,3-butadiene. Additionally, these sites record meteorological data such as wind that can impact air quality and distribution of any emissions.

This tool uses various views to help illustrate the measurements in visual format and communicate trends of concentrations over time across various sites. The dataset was acquired from the Kinder Urban Data Portal, containing hourly samples from TCEQ monitoring sites from 2020 with >50 chemical compounds.
